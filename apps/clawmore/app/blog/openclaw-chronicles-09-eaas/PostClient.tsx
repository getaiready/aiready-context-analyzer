          The Hub-and-Spoke Pattern
        </h2>
        <p className="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed text-lg italic mb-12">
          Scaling a single agent is easy. Orchestrating a swarm across thousand
          of AWS accounts is a different game entirely.
        </p>
        <p className="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-8">
          In ClawMore, we use a central **Hub** to maintain the global state of
          the Eclawnomy. Each customer project operates as a **Spoke**,
          connected to the hub via a secure EventBridge bridge. This allows for
          centralized intelligence with decentralized execution—a perfect model
          for serverless AI orchestration.

          Managed Evolution
        </h2>
        <p className="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-8">
          Instead of every spoke independently learning how to solve common
          problems, successful mutations in one spoke can be "harvested" and
          redistributed across the hub to other spokes. This is
          **Evolution-as-a-Service**.

          Account Vending
        </h2>
        <p className="text-zinc-200 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-24">
          To ensure security and zero-cost idling, each spoke is provisioned
          using an automated **Account Vending Machine**. This guarantees that
          every agentic swarm is physically isolated at the AWS account level,
          preventing cross-tenant "agentic noise" and ensuring that the only way
          a spoke can communicate with the hub is through the defined event
          schema.
